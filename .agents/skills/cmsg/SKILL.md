# Commit Message

Draft or create a commit message from the current diff.

## Inputs

1. By default, include both staged and unstaged changes in the message or commit.
2. If the user explicitly asks for staged-only, index-only, or already-staged changes, use only the staged diff.
3. If the user asks for a commit and there are unstaged changes included by default, stage those included changes before committing.
4. Read recent commits for repository style.

## Style

- Follow the repository's recent commit style when clear.
- Default to Conventional Commits:

```text
type(scope): imperative summary
```

- Keep the subject at or below 72 characters when practical.
- Use a body when it explains motivation, root cause, risk, or rejected alternatives.
- Do not include `Co-Authored-By` unless explicitly requested.
- Do not include issue-closing keywords unless the user asks or the surrounding workflow requires it.

## Output

For `cmsg`, print only a fenced commit message.

For `cmsg and commit`, run `git commit` with the drafted message, then report the new commit SHA and subject.
